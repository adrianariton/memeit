# memeit

## Run site with npm start. 
Dependencies:
- Node and express.js
- Git terminal (for windows)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a linux terminal for windows but if you've worked with webdev you probably already got it.

Usually the app runs either on port 3000 or 8080 (very unlikely tho).
